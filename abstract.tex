Formation coordination for distributed Unmanned Ariel Vehicle (UAV) has been a challenging topic. Without a leader that computes the formation for other teammates, each UAV needs to make its own decision to form the formation. However, in a battlefield environment, UAVs are required to react dynamically and immediately, and therefore less computing cost of formation planning is essential. Consequently, we propose a flexible formation coordination scheme for such a problem. Similar to a flock of birds or a school of fish, they move without a specific formation, maintaining the compactness of the relative position among each other without collision. Despite other teammates join the team or crush while flying, UAVs can still keep the formation and complete the mission. The UAVs with the proposed distributed formation path planning algorithms can accomplish the tasks satisfactorily and flexibly.
