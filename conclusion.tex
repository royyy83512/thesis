\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we have considered UAVs flying in several potential unknown environments such as multiple obstacles and traffic congestion, where they should autonomously and distributively coordinate their formation to carry out the mission. We have proposed a dynamic path planning algorithm based on a look ahead scoring system to prompt UAVs to form compactly for this particular problem. We have demonstrated via simulations that the proposed scheme successfully solves the above problem. 

In our distributed structure, the best trajectory is based on a virtual leader calculated from the geometric center of gravity, which only requires its neighbor's positions. Our current experiments assume only a single common goal is to be carried out. However, many more complicated applications may require multiple goals or tasks to be accomplished by the UAVs. Therefore, our further work includes getting feedbacks from neighbors for each UAV after making a decision and designing other communication protocols that can improve its behaviors by negotiating their roles in carrying out multi-goals or tasks. This work has founded the basis of flexible path planning to be extended to more complicated tasks to be carried out by a swarm of UAVs.
