\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper we have considered the problem of UAVs flying in several potential unknown environments such as multiple obstacles and traffic congestion, where they should autonomous and distributively coordinate their formation in order to carry out the mission. For this particular problem we have proposed a dynamic path planning algorithm based on a look ahead scoring system to prompt UAVs to form compactly. We have demonstrated via simulations that the above problem is successfully solved by the proposed scheme. 

In our distributed structure, the best trajectory is based on a virtual leader that calculated from the geometric center of gravity, which only requires its neighbor's positions. Our current experiments assume only a single common goal is to be carried out, however, many more complicated applications may require multiple goals or tasks to be accomplished by the UAVs. Therefore, our further work includes getting feedbacks from neighbors for each UAV after making a decision and designing other communication protocols that can improve its behaviors by negotiating their roles in carrying out multi-goals or tasks. This work have founded the basis of flexible path planning to be extended to more complicated tasks to be carried out by a swarm of UAVs.
